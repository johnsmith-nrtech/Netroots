                <strong>Tailored to Fit Your Unique Business Needs</strong>
                <br />
                Every business operates differently, and AIMS (Standard) understands that one-size-fits-all solutions often fall short. 
                That’s why the system is built with customization flexibility at its core, empowering businesses to shape the software 
                according to their exact workflows and preferences.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
                From the very first setup, AIMS (Standard) allows you to choose and activate only the modules relevant to your operations
                be it Accounting, Inventory, POS, Purchase, Sales, or Reporting. As your business grows, you can add more modules without 
                needing a complete system overhaul.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Flexible Chart of Accounts & Reporting</h3>
            <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
                The system supports custom Chart of Accounts (COA) structures, allowing organizations to align their financial records 
                with internal policies or external regulatory requirements. Reporting formats can also be customized, including branded 
                invoice templates, tax summaries, and multi-level dashboards tailored to the management team’s KPIs.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">User Roles, Access & Workflows</h3>
            <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
                With customizable user roles and permissions, you can control who accesses what within the platform. You can also define 
                approval hierarchies, set up email alerts for specific actions, and create automated workflows that match your internal 
                processes whether for order approvals, stock transfers, or payment verifications.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Field Customization & Localization</h3>
            <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
                Businesses can rename fields, add custom fields to forms, and even hide or show data based on user type. The software 
                supports both Urdu and English, and localized tax rules (GST/SRB) can be configured based on region and industry. Currency, 
                units of measurement, and barcode formats are all adjustable.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Built for Adaptability</h3>
            <p className="mb-4 text-justify">
                Whether you are a retailer, wholesaler, manufacturer, or service provider, AIMS (Standard) provides the flexibility 
                to adapt without needing any coding knowledge. Our technical team can also offer advanced customizations on request,
